The inspiration for this page is for users to be able to search for gifs in a fun search engine type of page. The requirements for this page were to be constructed using html, scss-css and javascript. There are some components of flex box, the giphy api, and JSON.

In this page, you are able to navigate by searching for an image and pressing the submit button. This renders the api images on the page.

Improvements:
1.	I would like the images to display betterâ€”flexbox was not rendering the images how I wanted.
2.	I would like to add function to the drop down menu.
3.	I would like to improve the detailing of the page in general.
